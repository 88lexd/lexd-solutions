# Manual calc to test logic
# Raw Total: 2850

# All split = 500+2000+50 = 2550
#   Each (/4) is 637.5

# Jess,Amanda = 100/2 = 50
#   Each total is 637.5+50 = 687.5

# Alex,Andrew = 200/2 = 100
#   Each total is 637.5+100 = 737.5

# 737.5 x 2 = 1475
# 687.5 x 2 = 1375

# 1375 + 1475 = 2850... Calculation is correct.
